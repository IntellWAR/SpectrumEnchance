# Development and software implementation of processing algorithms for a compact luminescence spectrograph

This repository contains the entire software development process for processing and improving the spectrum obtained by using a prototype of the [_compact luminescence spectrograph_](https://www.overleaf.com/project/62e26e38866668ee2a52f5b1)

### Philosophical meaning (purpose) of the project

Nowadays, the task of testing the quality of water from various sources and analyzing it for suitability for consumption is very important. However, currently used [methods](https://testslab.ru/stati/metody-analiza-vody/#:~:text=%D0%9B%D1%8E%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D1%82%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D0%B8,%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D0%B2%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%85%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8E%D1%82%20%D1%85%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%8E) are often used only in laboratory conditions and are expensive and difficult to use. In turn, portable luminescent spectrographs, due to high requirements for precise alignment of the optical path and the quality of the dispersing element itself, [cost] (https://aliexpress.ru/wholesale?SearchText=fluorescence+spectrophotometer&g=y&page=1&searchInfo=UeihUK8Yw0p7m0kK8rWUKQav9w%2F+9ysNUE3T21jdsWJLiHcifsoBkPSCd0kOhGpzFa0EOTe8gFMFJmEHO18K2KIYu6xu7G3Mqe%2FZXlsYbdJJOnwoRjWnsjJQNIjwp3qp4MeBFHghLjvAXQV2RMfCunpFB+N1qgjskc%2FKLQAv6DNdQraDNjY%3D) more than the average monthly salary
