# Development and software implementation of processing algorithms for a compact luminescence spectrograph

This repository contains the entire software development process for processing and improving the spectrum obtained by
using a prototype of the _compact luminescence spectrograph_ (You can see the user manual in the file
_Spectrograf_2022.pdf_)

### Get Started

#### Requirements

- Windows OS
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) version 3.10+
- The pip utility built into python
- Venv utility built into python

#### Installation

1. Download repository
2. Open cmd in the root folder
3. Create and activate [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```
python -m venv env

env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

4. Install libraries:

```
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```

#### Usage

To get spectrum and analyse it by some metrics (noise level, signal-to-noise ratio) you can use *get_spectrum.py*:

1. At the top of the file in *dir = path.normpath(" ")* inside " " insert a link to the directory with the source data.
   For example *dir = path.normpath("static/ec02a37a-2134-430f-944e-37bdc1a79d8f")*
2. With activated venv run next code in cmd

```
py get_spectrum.py
```

To get spectrum with subtraction of the reference with obtaining the appropriate metrics use *Spectrum_with_ref.py*:

1. At the top of the file in *dir_ref = path.normpath(" ")* and *dir = path.normpath(" ")* inside " " insert links to
   the directories with the source data of the reference spectrum and the studied one, respectively.
2. With activated venv run next code in cmd

```
py Spectrum_with_ref.py
```

The result of the work of the earlier mentioned algorithms can be found in *logs_[name_of_the_source_directory]* next to
this directory.
Also an example of the source data and result of the algorithm you can see in
the [online cloud](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/yVBGErGbLEkZqQ).

### Philosophical meaning (purpose) of the project

Nowadays, the task of testing the quality of water from various sources and analyzing it for suitability for consumption
is very important. However, currently
used [methods](https://testslab.ru/stati/metody-analiza-vody/#:~:text=%D0%9B%D1%8E%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D1%82%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D0%B8,%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D0%B2%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%85%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8E%D1%82%20%D1%85%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%8E)
are often used in laboratory conditions and are expensive and difficult to use. In turn, portable luminescent
spectrographs, due to high requirements for precise alignment of the optical path and the quality of the dispersing
element
itself, [cost](https://aliexpress.ru/wholesale?SearchText=fluorescence+spectrophotometer&g=y&page=1&searchInfo=UeihUK8Yw0p7m0kK8rWUKQav9w%2F+9ysNUE3T21jdsWJLiHcifsoBkPSCd0kOhGpzFa0EOTe8gFMFJmEHO18K2KIYu6xu7G3Mqe%2FZXlsYbdJJOnwoRjWnsjJQNIjwp3qp4MeBFHghLjvAXQV2RMfCunpFB+N1qgjskc%2FKLQAv6DNdQraDNjY%3D)
more than the average monthly salary.

So the idea of the project is to use a spectrograph assembled from cheap and low-precision materials and compensate for
accuracy through software processing. The success of this work will greatly simplify the sample preparation and analysis
of water, which can have a strong impact on many areas from monitoring sludge waters of hydraulic structures to simply
determining the suitability of water for drinking in the field.

### Project goal

Thus, the task of this project is to compensate for such distortions occurring inside the optical path of the
spectrograph as:

- Ð¡hromatic aberration
- Astigmatism
- Parasitic illumination
- Noises
- And others

As well as improving image characteristics such as:

- Resolution
- Dynamic range
